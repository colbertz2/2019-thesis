The existing system in the ufE Lab has the capability of measuring emission spectra in both the visible and near-infrared (NIR) ranges. However, the detector used to measure NIR light must be cooled with liquid nitrogen, which makes those measurements quite costly.

Future work on this project will attempt to expand the new system's sensitivity into the NIR range by using a reflective grating and linear InGaAs array camera (sensitive in the NIR region) to measure sample emissions.
