## Introduction
I have not invested quite as much time as I should have in this draft, but will work on getting back into the habit of writing something every day.

## Changes to Results Section
Found a new reference (Platt) that seems to have some useful data and background on ADT TES-F. Should be able to get some useful characteristics of the material out of their results section, and references from their paper may have good background on the material and why it behaves the way it does. Platt's Figure 3 raised a new question for me: I have a lot of plots with similar peaks to the ones in my Figure 3, but none of them are precisely at the same wavelength and definitely not the same intensity. I'm assuming that this is because we're exciting the material at different wavelengths/intensities, but I don't know for certain (and couldn't write about this scientifically). That's worth a lot more exploration.

Figure 2 and Figure 4 are new. These show images of the samples I measured for Figures 3 and 5, respectively. Without thinking very deeply on the subject, I think that short captions are appropriate here. There's not a lot to say, unless it's reasonable to repeat some of what I've written in the text so that the figures can better stand on their own.

## Changes to Formatting
I also made some formatting improvements, suggested by Ethan in his March 20 email. This includes changing the LaTex document type to article, setting font size to 12 pt, setting margins to 1 inch, and adding line spacing. 

I had to change some keywords in the LaTex source to work with the new document type, but overall did not have to make significant revisions.
