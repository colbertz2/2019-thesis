Photoluminescence (PL) emission is an important characteristic measurement in the field of solid-state physics research. It reveals information about the electron band structure of molecules, and is particularly useful in studying thin-film materials on micron spatial scales. This work sought to design and build a simple system which can accurately measure PL in thin-film materials by applying targeted, monochromatic illumination to the sample.

By coupling a diode laser system into a metallurgical microscope, we were able to filter out a substantial amount of reflected light and measure the spectrum of sample emissions with a high degree of accuracy compared to literature results.
