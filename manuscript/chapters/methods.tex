\subsection{Design}

\subsubsection{Microscope}

The starting point of the project was an Olympus BX60M fluorescence microscope. The BX60M is built for reflection microscopy, and includes a housing for brightfield and darkfield mirrors. For the new instrument, we added a mirror cube housing between the brightfield/darkfield mirror housing and the observation tube. This additional component housed a dichroic mirror, which enabled us to couple an external light source into the instrument and filter that light out of the path through the observation tube.

\subsubsection{Laser Excitation}
The BX60M is equipped with a xenon arc lamp, which is used for general observations under white light illumination. In order to measure photoluminescence, we require the use of a (mostly) monochromatic light source which is energetic enough to excite electrons in the sample.

Our instrument uses a diode laser as its light source. Specifically, we used a ThorLabs L405P20 laser diode (405 nm), TCLDM9 thermoelectrically-cooled mount, LDC 202 laser diode controller, and TED 200 temperature controller. To couple the laser and microscope, we used a set of two mirrors in a vertical beam fold configuration. This enabled precise alignment of the laser to the optical axis of the microscope, maximizing transmission of excitation light through the objective lens and onto the sample stage.

\end{figure}

The laser diode housing and first mirror were mounted to an optical table. The laser starts parallel to the surface of the table and the first mirror directs the beam upward. The second mirror in the beam fold was mounted to the end of a tube that extends out the side of the mirror cube housing. This mirror directs the vertical beam horizontally into the mirror. It seems preferable to mount both mirrors to the optical table for stability, but we were successful with this method by mounting the microscope to the table so that it and the second mirror did not move relative to the laser beam during normal operation.

\end{figure}

It was not feasible to align the laser diode housing and mirror cube housing in the plane of the table due to limited space on the optical table. To overcome this, our beam fold configuration also turns the beam 90 degrees in the plane of the table. The configuration we used has the laser beam initially pointed in the direction of the operator, then directed upward by the first mirror, then directed into the side of the mirror cube housing. While in operation, but particularly during laser alignment, precautions must be taken to protect the operator's eyes from direct exposure to the laser beam. The optical power of the laser is low enough that laser safety glasses (with high optical density near 405 nm) are sufficient, but beam blocks on the table may also be desireable in some cases.

We used a longpass dichroic mirror with a cutoff wavelength slightly higher than the excitation wavelength at 405 nm, causing nearly all of the excitation light to be reflected in the direction of the sample. A longpass mirror with cutoff wavelength slightly higher than the excitation wavelength is ideal beacuse it will pass most of the light emitted by the sample, as we expect fluorescence to nearly always have a longer wavelength than the exciting photons.

% Because fluorescence will nearly always have a longer wavelength than the exciting photons, we expect the mirror to pass most of the light emitted by the sample and block any reflected excitation light.

The observation tube on the Olympus BX60M is at the top of the microscope's optical path; the operator can toggle between using the observation tube or binocular optic. To collect and measure the spectrum of fluorescent emissions, we fixed a collimating adapter to the observation tube. This allowed us to collect emissions and transmit them via optical fiber to our spectromter.

We used an Ocean Optics (now Ocean Insight) USB2000 miniature spectrometer to measure the spectra shown in Chapter \ref{chap:results}. The USB2000 is sensitive to light between about 350 nm and 1000 nm, so in this case we are only able to measure fluorescent emissions in the visible spectrum and a small part of the near-infrared spectrum. This detector can easily be exchanged for one with a different range as required for future projects.

The USB spectrometer is connected to a nearby desktop computer, with Ocean Optics software installed for measuring spectra.

We were able to fix a digital camera to the binocular optic for simple imaging of samples with adapters on hand. The camera is connected via USB to a desktop computer with software for capturing images. Example images are shown in Figures \ref{img:tesf} and \ref{img:qd}.


\subsection{Laser Alignment}
We align the laser to the microscope's optical axis by iteratively adjusting the two flat mirrors that direct the beam into the side of the microscope. First, we adjust the position of the beam as it enters the mirror cube housing by moving the first mirror. A reticle made of photoluminescent laser viewing material was a particularly useful target when fixed to the opening on the side of the mirror cube housing. 

We then adjust the second mirror in the beam fold to change the angle at which the beam is incident on the dichroic mirror. This translates the beam across the back of the microscope nosepiece, where our target is the optical axis of the objective lens. In place of a lens, we fix an iris diaphragm to the nosepiece. We adjust the second mirror to position the laser in the center of the mostly-closed iris, which marks the location of the optical axis of a lens. This process is repeated until the laser spot is centered on both targets.
