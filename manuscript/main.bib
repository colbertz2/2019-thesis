	doi = {10.1117/12.875375},
	abstract = {We present optical, photoluminescent (PL), and photoconductive properties of functionalized anthradithiophene (ADT) derivatives and their composites. Solution-deposited ADT films exhibit charge carrier mobilities of over 1.5 cm 2 /(Vs), high PL quantum yields, and high photoconductivity. We show that molecular arrangement and intermolecular interactions significantly contribute to (opto)electronic properties of guest-host thin films of these pi-stacked materials. Specifically, the formation of aggregates plays an important role in establishing efficient conduction pathways in ADT derivatives dispersed in a host matrix. In addition, the extent and nature of aggregation and the resulting changes in PL and photoconductive behavior can be effectively manipulated through different film fabrications techniques. Furthermore, energy transfer and exciplex formation has been shown to occur between two different ADT derivatives, which also alters the photoconductive response of the systems. We explore the dependence of the photoconductive response of such guest-host systems on excitation wavelength.},

	abstract = {The formation of narrow size dispersed and nanometer size aggregates (clusters) of cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) and their temperature-sensitive photoluminescence (PL) spectral properties close to room temperature (298 K) are discussed. CdSe QDs formed stable clusters with an average diameter of ∼27 nm in the absence of coordinating solvents. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, we identified the association of individual QDs with 2−5 nm diameters into clusters of uniform size. A suspension of these clusters in different solvents exhibited reversible PL intensity changes and PL spectral shifts which were correlated with temperature. Although the PL intensity of CdSe QDs encapsulated in host matrixes and the solid state showed a response to temperature under cryogenic conditions, the current work identified for the first time QD clusters showing temperature-sensitive PL intensity variations and spectral shifts at moderate temperatures above room temperature. Temperature-sensitive reversible PL changes of clusters are discussed with respect to reversible thermal trapping of electrons at inter-QD interfaces and dipole−dipole interactions in clusters. Reversible luminescence intensity variations and spectral shifts of QD clusters show the potential for developing sensors based on QD nanoscale assemblies.},

The technological promises include low cost of these materials and the possibility of their room-temperature deposition from solution on large-area and/or flexible substrates. The article reviews the current understanding of the physical mechanisms that determine the (opto)electronic properties of high-performance organic materials. The focus of the review is on photoinduced processes and on electronic properties important for optoelectronic applications relying on charge carrier photogeneration. Additionally, it highlights the capabilities of various experimental techniques for characterization of these materials, summarizes top-of-the-line device performance, and outlines recent trends in the further development of the field. The properties of materials based both on small molecules and on conjugated polymers are considered, and their applications in organic solar cells, photodetectors, and photorefractive devices are discussed.},
