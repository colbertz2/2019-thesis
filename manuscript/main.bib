We show that molecular arrangement and intermolecular interactions significantly contribute to (opto)electronic properties of guest-host thin films of these pi-stacked materials. Specifically, the formation of aggregates plays an important role in establishing efficient conduction pathways in ADT derivatives dispersed in a host matrix. In addition, the extent and nature of aggregation and the resulting changes in PL and photoconductive behavior can be effectively manipulated through different film fabrications techniques. Furthermore, energy transfer and exciplex formation has been shown to occur between two different ADT derivatives, which also alters the photoconductive response of the systems. We explore the dependence of the photoconductive response of such guest-host systems on excitation wavelength.},

CdSe QDs formed stable clusters with an average diameter of ∼27 nm in the absence of coordinating solvents. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, we identified the association of individual QDs with 2−5 nm diameters into clusters of uniform size. A suspension of these clusters in different solvents exhibited reversible PL intensity changes and PL spectral shifts which were correlated with temperature. Although the PL intensity of CdSe QDs encapsulated in host matrixes and the solid state showed a response to temperature under cryogenic conditions, the current work identified for the first time QD clusters showing temperature-sensitive PL intensity variations and spectral shifts at moderate temperatures above room temperature. Temperature-sensitive reversible PL changes of clusters are discussed with respect to reversible thermal trapping of electrons at inter-QD interfaces and dipole−dipole interactions in clusters. Reversible luminescence intensity variations and spectral shifts of QD clusters show the potential for developing sensors based on QD nanoscale assemblies.},

The focus of the review is on photoinduced processes and on electronic properties important for optoelectronic applications relying on charge carrier photogeneration. Additionally, it highlights the capabilities of various experimental techniques for characterization of these materials, summarizes top-of-the-line device performance, and outlines recent trends in the further development of the field. The properties of materials based both on small molecules and on conjugated polymers are considered, and their applications in organic solar cells, photodetectors, and photorefractive devices are discussed.},

	abstract = {Quantum yield is an important, characteristic quantity to be measured for fluorescent compounds. Here, a comparative method between fluorescent compounds in solution is applied to measure unknown quantum yields. An absorption spectrometer was used to measure the absorbances of two different fluorescent quantum yield standards. The integrated fluorescence intensities were obtained using a double monochromator and plotted against the corresponding absorbances, resulting in two calibration curves. The fluorescence quantum yields of cresyl violet and fluorescein calculated via these curves were 0.55±0.02 and 0.77±0.01, respectively. These are within 2.7\% and 2.9\% of their respective literature values. The quantum yields of zinc-oxide(ZnO) microspheres and Anthradithiophenetriethylsilylethynyl-fluorine(ADT-TES-F) in solution were also measured. The results for the ZnO microspheres were inconclusive, but the ADT-TES-F trial gave a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.44. The implementation of this method allows for the easy measurement of quantum yields with reasonable accuracy in the future.},

	abstract = {Unlike the majority of electronic devices, which are silicon based, optoelectronic devices are predominantly made using III–V semiconductor compounds such as GaAs, InP, GaN, and GaSb, and their alloys due to their direct-band gap. Understanding the properties of these materials has been of vital importance in the development of optoelectronic devices. Since the first demonstration of a semiconductor laser in the early 1960s, optoelectronic devices have been produced in their millions, pervading our everyday lives in communications, computing, entertainment, lighting, and medicine. It is perhaps their use in optical-fiber communications that has had the greatest impact on humankind, enabling high-quality and inexpensive voice and data transmission across the globe. Optical communications spawned a number of developments in optoelectronics, leading to devices such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, semiconductor optical amplifiers, optical modulators, and avalanche photodiodes. In this chapter, we discuss the underlying theory of operation of some important optoelectronic devices. The influence of carrier–photon interactions is discussed in the context of producing efficient and high-performance emitters and detectors. Finally, we discuss how the semiconductor band structure can be manipulated to enhance device properties using quantum confinement and strain effects, and how the addition of dilute amounts of elements such as nitrogen and bismuth is having a profound effect on the next generation of optoelectronic devices.},

We show molecular arrangement and intermolecular interactions signiﬁcantly contribute to the (opto)electronic properties of thin ﬁlms of these pi-stacked materials. In addition, these properties can be eﬀectively manipulated through the addition of guest molecules to a host material. In particular, exciton and charge carrier dynamics can be varied using a competition between photoinduced charge and energy transfer in a guest-host system. To better understand these processes at a molecular level, we apply single-molecule ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (SMFS) to probe the eﬀects of intermolecular interactions on the molecular properties. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that ADT molecules exhibit high enough quantum yields and photostability to be imaged on a single-molecule level at room temperature. Moreover, we show that stability of single ADT molecules immobilized in a solid-state matrix are comparable to those of the best ﬂuorophores utilized in SMFS.},

Preparation of monodisperse samples enables systematic characterization of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of materials as they evolve from molecular to bulk in the nanometer size range. Sample uniformity makes it possible to manipulate nanocrystals into close-packed, glassy, and ordered nanocrystal assemblies (superlattices, colloidal crystals, supercrystals). Rigorous structural characterization is critical to understanding the electronic and optical properties of both nanocrystals and their assemblies. At inter-particle separations 5–100 Å, dipole-dipole interactions lead to energy transfer between neighboring nanocrystals, and electronic tunneling between proximal nanocrystals gives rise to dark and photoconductivity. At separations {\textless}5 Å, exchange interactions cause otherwise insulating assemblies to become semiconducting, metallic, or superconducting depending on nanocrystal composition. Tailoring the size and composition of the nanocrystals and the length and electronic structure of the matrix may tune the properties of nanocrystal solid-state materials.},
