## Results and qualifying success
How would a company selling this setup test it to make sure it works?

+ Spectrometer calibration -- measure something with sharp spectral lines?
+ Noisy spectra come from lower excitation power. Use same excitation power between systems?
    + "Inhomogeneous broadening"
+ Measure spatially resolved PL with the laser to help with "wide field illumination" argument?
+ Power dependent PL? Measure excitation power vs. PL intensity
    + Check how intensity and shape of spectrum change with power
    + Is the dependence linear or nonlinear? At what point does it change to nonlinear?

+ Add polarization dependence measurements to the system. Talk to Gina?
