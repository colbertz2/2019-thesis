The trinocular optic allows multiple detectors to be connected to the system. In this case, we use a digital microscope camera for general imaging of samples, and an Ocean Optics USB spectrometer for measuring emission spectra. 

The camera is connected to the trinocular directly, but the spectrometer must be coupled to the system using a fiber optic.
