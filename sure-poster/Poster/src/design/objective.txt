The microscope's objective lens serves a dual-purpose. It takes the laser beam, which may be as wide as 3-5mm, and focuses it down to a point on the same order of magnitude as the sample (this ultimately makes single-domain illumination possible). It also collects light from the sample and directs it back up through the microscope.
