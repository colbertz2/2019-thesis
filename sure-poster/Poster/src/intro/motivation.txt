The Micro-Femto Energetics (ufE) Lab has a system capable of measuring both PL emission and excitation of materials. While the system has a diverse set of uses and is scientifically valuable to have, it has certain drawbacks that make it challenging to use.

Researchers taking measurements with this system have to invest up to 90 minutes of time into starting-up and shutting-down the system, which makes cursory measurement of samples impractical. Because the system has a wide variety of uses, optical equipment often has to be reconfigured around it.

The system uses a xenon-arc lamp and monochromator as its light source, leading to wide-field illumination on samples. This is significant for crystalline structures and nanomaterials, which often require illumination of a single molecular domain. 

This project aimed to resolve these issues by designing a system that could measure PL emission of samples accurately, quickly, and with the potential for single-domain illumination.
